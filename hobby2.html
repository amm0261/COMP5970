<H1>Jet Skiing</H1>
I love anything watersports related and spend a lot of time on the lake riding boats and jet skis during the summer! I've ridden all over the southeast and also spent some time riding on the West Coast! During the winter, I switch to snowmobiling and skiing since it's pretty much the same thing but on land.
